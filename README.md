This is a sample of the work I did on a project I worked on for over a year. Because much of the data and ongoing research is proprietary, this is only a small sample.
The Model_Output notebook shows two examples of model validation I performed on this project. The first example is a comparison of ocean color chlorophyll data and modeled chlorophyll data. This is done by estimating the satellite light attenuation to create a comparable model product of the ocean color data. This data is compared over three regions with both onshore and offshore data. In order to compare the two datasets the ocean color data had to be interpolated to match the modeled data. 
As our model progressed the nitrate concentrations shifted in a way that was not naturally explainable. The NO3_Budget notebook is meant to close the nitrate budget of the modeled data to try to understand some of our issues with the nitrate concentrations in the model. I accomplished this by using Stokes theorem to calculate a volume integrated divergence through a region.

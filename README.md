This is a sample of the work I did on a project I worked on for over a year. Because much of the data and ongoing research is proprietary, this is only a small sample.

My role on this project was to collect and analyze in situ data and use that to validate the model data and suggest tweaks to help with future runs. I was also resposible or QA/QC of the modeled data. Please lookthrough the notebook to see a sample of the work I did.
